      	<h4>Interview with Marianne</h4>
      	<p> Marianne had her boss shave her head to look like a boy's haircut so that Russian soldiers would not attempt to take advantage of her. She was living in a coal cellar where no one knew where she was. Her bosses brother hung himself in that coal cellar while she was hiding. She worked in dunsig for the Russians as a boy. Eventually she was able to have a polish woman, who was a secretary for the Russians get her a travel pass so she could head west. She took a cattle train (which she said were often robbed) and she headed west. Every day she would have to board the train and every night she would sleep on the streets outside the train station.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Death and disease were everywhere in Germany. Many of Stalin's soldier had contracted venerial diseses, lice, and other diseases. Marianne said she couldn't drink water, it was all polluted. 
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Marianne made it to Berlin and there she was determined to get a job and start living a semi-normal life again. She headed to town to inquire about getting a job. She was told there were already too many refugees in the city and she needed to go home. She went back everyday and talked to the same officer. Finally after pleaded with him, "If I were your daugher would you send me away?" He told her to come back, and she was able to go to a nearby florist and eventually was able to get a job. After a while she started to long for her family or her "tribe" as she has always called it. She started posting messages on a wall where people put missing family. A woman recognized her mother's name and told her to come visit so she could tell her where to find them. This woman lived in the Russian division of Berlin. She got clearance to cross the border and was told where she could find her parents.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		She felt she had to leave Berlin. Against all her friends warning her to stay. She boarded a train and headed back east. She was eventually able to find her mother and two brothers. They were living above a tavern in a very small apartment. She decided she had to stay to help them. She went back to Berlin to gather her belongings and came back to help them live their lives.
